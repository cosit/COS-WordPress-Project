== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to add more than one twitter feed on my blog? =

You have to use the "id" section on your shortcode. For example, the first twitter feed will be: [minitwitter id=1 username="ladygaga"] and the second feed: [minitwitter id=2 username="justinbieber"]. The widget section does it automatically.

= What are the "query" and "list" fields in the widget section? =

The field "query" is NOT required. It is only to show themes or sentences like "#worldcup".
The field "list" is NOT required too. It is to display the tweets of one of your list.
